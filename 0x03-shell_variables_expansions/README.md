# 0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions

This directory contains shell scripts that demonstrate the use of:

- Shell initialization files
- Shell variables (local and global)
- Shell parameter expansions
- Command substitution
- Aliases
- Shell arithmetic

Each script focuses on one specific concept and helps build a solid understanding of how the shell environment works.
